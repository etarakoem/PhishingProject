# PhishingProject

### Phishing walkthrough 1:

Greetings and welcome to my Phishing walkthrough project!

Phishing is the most common attack performed by cybercriminals despite its simplicity. With only a fake login site, anyone without awareness can be fooled into giving in their login credential and lost their accounts.

In this video, I will walkthrough a phishing site to show what it's like when you click on a phishing site and how hackers target users' curiosity.

(Note: the Language of this clip is still Vietnamese as I intentionally made it for the Vietnamese community in order to raise cybersecurity awareness. English Sub/dub comming soon!)

### Phishing wakthrough 2:

In this video, I will show you a small web bruteforcing tool, [dirb] (https://www.kali.org/tools/dirb/)
I use this tool to bruteforcing and explore Phishing site.
During this, dirb led me to a site in which hacker leave their victims' credential in a table.

You can find similar tools like [Gobuster] (https://www.kali.org/tools/gobuster/), [dirbuster] (https://www.kali.org/tools/dirbuster/) which serves the same purpose.

Whenever you come accross a hacking site, use these tools to explore if the Hackers are carelessly enough to leave any important file at places they shouldn't be!

The two phishing site had been taken down. These phishing sites usually survive a week or two before they're being reported and flag for Facebook to take down. Therefore, if you happen to come accross these phishing sites, give these tools a try and explore them! But do aware the possibility of being hacked!

Happy hacking!
