# PhishingProject

### Phishing walkthrough 1:

Greetings and welcome to my Phishing walkthrough project!

Phishing is the most common attack performed by cybercriminals despite its simplicity. With only a fake login site, anyone without awareness can be fooled into giving in their login credential and lost their accounts.

In this video, I will walk through a phishing site to show what it's like when you click on a phishing site and how hackers target users' curiosity.

(Note: the Language of this clip is still Vietnamese as I intentionally made it for the Vietnamese community in order to raise cybersecurity awareness. English Sub/dub coming soon!)

### Phishing walkthrough 2:

In this video, I will show you a small web brute-forcing tool, [dirb](https://www.kali.org/tools/dirb/)
I use this tool to brute-forcing and explore Phishing sites.
During this, dirb led me to a site in which hackers leave their victims' credentials on a table.

You can find similar tools like [Gobuster](https://www.kali.org/tools/gobuster/), [dirbuster](https://www.kali.org/tools/dirbuster/) which serves the same purpose.

Whenever you come across a hacking site, use these tools to explore if the Hackers are careless enough to leave any important file at places they shouldn't be!

I successfully retrieved a list of [victims' login credentials](https://github.com/etarakoem/PhishingProject/files/7964698/Admin.Result.pdf). 
Although the hacker changed their original login credentials already, this is one of the first successful hacking attempts and findings I ever had in my Pentesting path.
One thing to notice is that the Vietnamese pattern of setting passwords is name + date of birth, or name + a set of numbers.

The two phishing sites had been taken down. These phishing sites usually survive a week or two before they're being reported and flagged for Facebook to take down. After that, they'll come back, with different site names and the same pattern. Therefore, if you happen to come across these phishing sites, give these tools a try and explore them! 

(But be aware of the possibility of being hacked too)

Happy hacking!
